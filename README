All of the source is in the src directory and all of the JavaDoc is in the dist directory.  All code is licensed under the LGPL, so it is free to use by anyone provided it is used according to the terms of the LGPL.  The whole text of the LGPL can be found in the file "LICENSE".

In this branch, I've implemented Lab4 by recursively creating all possible solutions (possible combinations of all free variables in a Rule), which is inherently really slow, so I optimized it by creating two extra TreeSets, one that holds all predicates that have evaluated to true and one that holds all predicates that have evaluated to false.  On one of the tests given, my code took nearly two minutes without these optimizations and about 4 seconds with the optimizations.  I'll leave this branch here, but I may implement this better and create a new branch for it.  This is, after all, just for educational purposes anyway.
